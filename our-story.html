                <h1>Why Coffee?</h1>
            <p>
                Coffee in a way chose us. When starting the business we began thinking about what product or common good intersects with real life. What do people center their lives around outside of work or home life? Various things came to mind like food, sports, pubs and …coffee.</p>
<p>
A term we learned along the way was “third place” environments. In other words a place that is not your home or your work, but a third place that you spend your time. Coffee shops not only fill that category, they meet that criteria on many different demographics and social levels.</p>

<p>
Coffee is a beverage enjoyed all over the world by all types of people. Research has suggested that 2 billion cups of coffee are consumed everyday! Once we began to see how common coffee was in everyday, ordinary life our hearts were inspired to dive deeper.</p>
<p>
Our team began researching coffee and the world that surrounds it. We got a little obsessed with coffee! in our journey we discovered how coffee was also a global commodity. Almost every place on our globe either drank coffee or grew it! We found that coffee was one of the top traded goods in all the earth.</p>
<p>
There was this inspiring moment when we realized how coffee connected people throughout the world and we were sold on the idea that coffee was for us.</p>
